# Installation
TODO: currently the environment is kind of messed up, I think there's a mix of conda and pip installs.  I couldn't get conda requirements to work (the packages were private?) so I'm using pip inside a conda environment right now which is probably dumb.  I had to manually install a few packages with pip. But, might just use Poetry or something or Dockerize it?
